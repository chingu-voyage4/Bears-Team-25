# Mission Statement

The chingu-x team have a requirement for a cms to better organise the voyage and pm wiki's on github. We will create a cms.

# Values

To achieve our goal we will:

* create software allowing users to easily access documentation
* create functionality allowing members to enter and update content
* create a simple [architecture](https://vimeo.com/43612849)

# Coding Standards

Coding standards will follow js recommended structure as per airbnb linter.

Spaces not tabs, 2 space indent. Create pretty code that is easy on the eye and understandable. We have decided to use prettier.


# Operating Strategies

## Stack

MERN. create-react-app. no redux yet, styled-components.

Emphasis on working software. Documentation and testing as appropriate to members experience/time.

## Meetings

There will be one meeting at the start of the project to agree the goals. Other video/voice calls maybe scheduled whne required.

Team members will keep in touch regularly using slack channel.

Each team member will submit standups atleast twice a week to facilitate progress monitoring.

## Source Control

We will use github to manage the project. Master branch will always contain latest working version of the software and be deployed to heroku. Development branch will contain latest version of software and be pushed to master weekly after testing by atleast two members of the team.

Team members will do all work on own branches. Branches will be pulled at the start of the day and pushed at the end of the day. See [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) resource for a successful git workflow.

A pull request will be created when a member branch is ready for merge to develop branch. The branch will be reviewed by atleast two team members.

# Roles and Responsibilities

All team members will support their fellow team members and share knowledge. Any team member suffering a block will flag the issue asap so other members may provide help.

All team members will be courteous. That said, a thick skin is always a plus in case someone gets a little excited!

# Accountability Pledge

I will commit to my team and commit to finishing the remote team project!

I commit to atleast two standups a week.

If something happens and I have to leave for an extended time I will communicate with my team and let them know. I wonâ€™t just disappear.
